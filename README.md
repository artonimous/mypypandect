Python3+ notes from books/blogs/tutorials/spikes - fewer places to have to look things up in.

There are so many great reasources available to learn the fundamentals of Python scripting (and beyond). However, I'm more of a 'pile.er' than a 'file.er' and the ecosystem-syntax is constantly evolving - so I've decided to try to put all those notes together in one place, in Jupyter Notebook form, and hopefully they will all be New Python (3.6) compliant.

I may also use this repository as a temporarily location for crysalis projects and personal curiosities should they emerge.

The only reason you are reading this is because it costs money to keep a repository private - not because you aren't welcome - on the contrary - rather, I just can not provide any warranty over the accuracy of anything included in these Notebooks as I have relied on others for all of the information and am a relative newbie to ThisDigitalStuff.

Source materials used to help compile the notes are credited - albeit these were originally used to tell me where to look things up again. So if I have unintentionally missed something - let me know - and thankyou very much for producing those materials (if you happen to have contributed to them).
